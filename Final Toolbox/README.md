###   *Overview*
<font size=".01"> For our final assignment in NRS 528 we were asked to create a Python Toolbox that contains a minimum of three simple tools that are able to undertake geoprocessing and file management operations. The three tools I decided to create are a ListRasters tool, a buffer by 100 meters tool, and a NDVI files tool.  </font>

### *ListRasters Tool*:
<font size=".01"> For the ListRasters tool, I wanted to allow the tool to search through a particular folder and list all of the raster files of a specific type. </font>

 ### *Buffer by 100 meters tool* :
 <font size=".01">  For the Buffer tool, you can add a minimum of two inputes that takes in a feature class and an output location for the file that is then generated. The tool then adds a 100 meter buffer to the file. </font>

 ### *NDVI tool* : 
 <font size=".01"> For my NDVI tool, there are 2-3 inputs and an output location. The input images have to be a new-infrared band and red visible light band for this calculation, otherwise it will not work. I used the data we used in class but had difficulties uploading it to GitHub. </font>
